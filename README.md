This is the buildconf for the rock build tests.

This buildconf will build rock.core as well as packages from [the
rock.build-tests package
set](https://github.com/rock-core/rock.build-tests-package_set). The result is
then checked by running the test suite from `build_tests/test`, which verifies
that everything behaved as expected.
